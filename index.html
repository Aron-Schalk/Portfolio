						There are many ways to market a product or a service and providing the potential clients and customers with testimonials is one of the best ways to market.
					</p>
					<p class="popup__text">
						The power of testimonials can never be underestimated. People, especially nowadays, 
						will only purchase products or avail services which have been referred to them by people whom they know. But most of the times, 
						this is not an option that is in the hands of the business owner, he has to do the next best thing, which is to get testimonials from his past clients. 
						Testimonials are living statements from past customers or clients which states that they were satisfied by the product/ service. 
						Every business must have testimonials to be able to stand out in the ever crowded markets.
